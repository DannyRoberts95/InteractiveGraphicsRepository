#Vectorised Motion P5

This sketch depicts a bouncing ball. This ball moves using vector values.


```js

	position = createVector(100, 100);
  	velocity = createVector(2.5, 10);


```

The ball's movement is acieved by adding speed vector to the position vector.  

```js

  position.add(velocity);

```

# Non-Vectorised Motion P5

This sketch depicts a bouncing ball. This ball moves using x and y location values.
These values will be replaced by vector values.


```js

	var x = 100;
	var y = 100;
	var xspeed = 2.5;
	var yspeed = 2;


```
Ball's movement is acieved by adding speed value to the x and y values.  
```js

  x = x + xspeed;
  y = y + yspeed;

```
